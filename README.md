# Flappy-Bird

This is a customized version of the flappy bird and my first android game. I consider this as a learning app. Most of the code comes from a tutotial from Brent Aureli's - Code School youtube channel. He is an awesome code teacher :)
Much of the credit goes to him. I only contributed my own code that hacked, modified, and customized the game to my taste.
