# Flappy-Trump

This is a customized version of the flappy bird and my first android game. I consider this as a learning app. Much of the code comes from a tutotial from Brent Aureli's - Code School youtube channel. He is an awesome code teacher :)
I contributed some of my own code to mod and customize the game to my taste. 

To download my game:
If on android then download and install the apk file in my master directory. Be sure to enable unknown sources on your android phone first.
If on linux, mac, windows, download the desktop jar file in my master directory. Be sure that you have java JDK installed on your computer first. 

This app is live on playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gao23.trumpbird

This app will be publish on the playstore for my own personal amusement. I also plan to recycle the source code to make similar mockery out of any future politicians.
