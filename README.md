# Flappy-Bird

This is a customized version of the flappy bird and my first android game. I consider this as a learning app. Most of the code comes from a tutotial from Brent Aureli's - Code School youtube channel. He is an awesome code teacher :)
Much of the credit goes to him. I only contributed my own code that hacked, modified, and customized the game to my taste. 

To download my game:
If on android then download and install the apk file in my master directory. Be sure to enable unknown sources on your android phone first.
If on linux, mac, windows, download the desktop jar file in my master directory. Be sure that you have java JDK installed on your computer first.
